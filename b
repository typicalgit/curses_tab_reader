To write a class in Python that has multiple objects associated with it, where those objects are defined by functions in another module, you can use the following approach:

1. Import the module containing the functions into your main script or module.

```python
import other_module
```

2. Define your class and its methods. Within the methods, you can use the functions from the other module to create objects and associate them with your class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.objects = []

    def add_object(self, data):
        obj = other_module.create_object(data)
        self.objects.append(obj)

    def remove_object(self, obj):
        self.objects.remove(obj)
```

3. In the above example, `create_object` is a function defined in the `other_module` used to create an object based on the provided data. Modify this according to your requirements.

4. You can now create instances of your class and use its methods to interact with the objects associated with it.

```python
my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.add_object('data1')
my_instance.add_object('data2')

print(my_instance.objects)  # Output: [object1, object2]

my_instance.remove_object(my_instance.objects[0])

print(my_instance.objects)  # Output: [object2]
```

Make sure that the module containing the functions (`other_module` in this example) is accessible from your main script or module by being in the same directory or added to the Python path.
